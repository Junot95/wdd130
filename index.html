    <p>Hey all, my name is Junot and I am married to one of the best women in the world called Navalona, and we have one son. We are from Madagascar island, but I work in Dubai. </p>
    <p>I love spending time with my family, doing outdoor activities. I also love playing soccer.</p>
    <p>I want to be a full stack web developer and that is why I am here. I have a little knowledge of HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery. However, I am very excited to learn more from all of you.</p>
